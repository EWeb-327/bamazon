## An Application like Amazon to buy, update and create products

**Through Node, this application has three user portals:**
* Customer
* Manager
* Supervisor

Each user can complete different tasks as indicated by the inquirer prompts. 

Customers can buy products--if there is inventory available they are given the total cost of their purchase, but if there is not enough inventory they are notified that the product is unavailable.

Managers can view products for sale--including the quantities and total product sales, view low inventory--shows any product with only 10 or less left in stock, add to inventory, and add new products.

Supervisors can view products sales by department--which lists departments by ID and name along with total product sales, over head costs and total profit, and create a new department then view all departments by id, name, and over head costs.

All three users have the option to either not move forward or exit the app.
